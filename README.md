Subject-Object Graph Generator (SOGG) is a script-based tool for writers to automatically generate interactive graphs from text descriptions of subjects, objects and their relationships.

# Q & A

## Who is it for?

Ideal for programmers and other advanced computer users who want to graph the entities and relationships of their story. It does not save your data, which is intentional. This can be inconvenient in some ways, but it gives you free control of your data. The script format is designed to be human-readable, so you can edit your story information on any text editor, (ideally with cloud backup) and copy and paste it into SOGG when you want it charted.

## How much does it cost?

SOGG is completely free. If you find it useful, and want to show your support, I'll be releasing my debut fantasy novel soon -- Heroes of Teraya - Tyranny of the Necromancer. I'll post a link and description once it is released. If you or someone you know likes to read fantasy novels (it will be wholesome), you can check it on Amazon and read the sample chapter.

## Why does SOGG exist?

I created SOGG to help me with my writing. There are a lot of well-developed, elaborate writing tools out there. I tried some of those, but they didn't work for me as I found it too slow to enter my data in a GUI. Also, when updates occurred, and when fetures were redesigned, my charts and data had to be redone which was tedious and a time-waster. So, I designed a tool where my data entry just text you can do anywhere, and the raw data is useable as is. The chart that is generated is basically a node graph, but instead of drawing the relationships with lines of multple angles, I kept all of the relationships horizantal for maximum readability. Typical node charts work very well when there is only type of connected relationship. SOGG allows you to have unlimited distinct custom relationship types.

## Why is it called Subject-Object Graph Generator (SOGG) and not something like Story Charter?

While I designed SOGG with a use case of novel writing, I wanted to leave the terminology generic as it may be useful for other use cases.

## Anything else I should know?

By default the page loads a small example of characters and other subjects and objects. Click the Generate button to see the graph and click around the graph to navigate your data. Replace the data in the text box with your own and click generate again.

SOGG does NOT save any of your data. So, please write and edit it in your favorite editor, and just paste it into SOGG. None of your data is sent to my server, so your privacy and rights are protected. Any graphs you generate are your own and you may use them for commercial or non-commercial uses. However, my source code is protected by copyright. You may not sell access to SOGG, or make a copy and host it elsewhere without my explicit written permission.
