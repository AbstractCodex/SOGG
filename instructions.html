        <h1>Usage</h1>

        <b>This web app only works on a large screen, like a desktop or tablet.</b>
        <br><br>
        Basic use: 
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Write your text as SOGG markdown in your favorite editor.</li>
            <li>Then paste it into the input box at the top of the page.</li>
            <li>Next click the Generate button.</li>
            <li>Then click around the generated diagram to navigate.</li>
        </ul>

        <br>

        What is SOGG markdown?
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Markdown is a common human-readable text format that can be displayed as formatted text.</li>
            <li>For SOGG, we use a variant of that format.</li>
            <li>For SOGG we have Categories and Subjects.</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>Example:
        <br>
        <br># Characters
        <br>## David
        <br>A powerful king of Israel.
        <br>role: King
        <br><br>

        In the above example:
        <ul>
            <li>Characters is the Category.</li>
            <li>David is an Subjects in that Category.</li>
            <li>Text under David will be interpreted as description.</li>
            <li>Colons are a special character. This is the key feature of SOGG. Text to the left of a colon is the relationship. You can write any relationship you want.</li>
            <li>Text after the relationship is the Object of the relationship. </li>
            <li>Ideally, the Object of a relationship will also be a Subject defined elsewhere. If so, it will automatically become a clickable chart link.</li>
            <li>You can have multiple Objects in a relationship. Separate them by commas.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Chart</h1>
        <br><br>
        The Subject-Object graph is an interactive node chart. The main difference between this type of chart and one you might 
        see on a site like <a href="https://www.freethesaurus.com/graph" target="_new">FreeThesaurus.com</a> is that the node lines have
        custom text to explain the relationship between nodes. Because this relationship text is very important, the relatiosnhips 
        are not drawn as lines at different angles, but horizantally with all the relationships listed clearly in bulleted lists.

        <br><br>
        If you click on a Subject or Object, if it has a entry as a subject in your data, the Focus Subject will change to that new Subject, 
        just as you would navigate in any node diagram.

        and just paste it into SOGG.
